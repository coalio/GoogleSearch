# GoogleSearch
A kinda hacky python web scraper for Google Search queries

## What?

Designed for those moments when you don't feel like opening the browser just for a simple question

## How?

Install dependencies:

Run `pip install -r dependencies.txt` 

To try it, run `python gsearch.py`

## What?

You can preview the content of the results by running `>x`, x being the result index
Or make another google search by just typing it

Example:

```
Google Search

empty website

Showing results for: empty website

```

You can make another search by just typing in the query (without any prefix), or you can leave the app by leaving the input empty and pressing enter or by typing `:q`
